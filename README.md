# HTML & CSS Capstone Project! An Original Website

> In this project, I used all the knowledge acquired throughout the HTML & CSS section. I used background images, gradients, flexbox, grids, input tags, links, anchor tags, semantic HTML, transitions, media queries, the Sass preprocessor, amongst many other tools I learned during this section of the main curriculum.

I created a unique website using all the tools learned during the HTML & CSS section. It is fully responsive, from the smallest smartphone to a large widescreen. The topic I chose for my project is about a course much like the one Microverse offers since I honestly believe is the best one out there.
