            We are software developers in continuous learning... Just like
            you! We love to learn and teach from our own experience, what has
            worked for us and what has not. What would have we done
            differently if we were starting over. We believe that the only way
            to achieve perfection is through practice and an organized
            methodology of teaching and learning. That is who we are and what
            we offer.

            I had been a software developer for many years now, and I was
            finding success while doing it, but I wanted more. This course
            gave me the tools I needed to take the next step in my
            professional career, and now I am a UI/UX designer at Google.

            I was a Marine Biologist working on extreme conditions, and
            although I loved it, I wanted to take my chances drifting towards
            a different sector. When I started learning to code, I knew it was
            perfect for me, so I decided to take it seriously. This course has
            opened me doors everywhere, I can not say enough good things about
            it!

            This course changed my life! I am a single mom taking care of 2
            little boys, and I was tired of choosing between my babies and my
            professional career. I was looking for a job that would allow me
            to stay at home and do both and that is when I found this course
            to learn to work remotely. Thank you for everything, now I can
            take care of the bills and my babies at the same time!

            I had been working for companies my whole life, and I have
            acquired a whole lot of experience. I wanted to share my
            experience with the world, and I knew that for that I needed to go
            online. I enrolled in this course so that I could start building
            my own website tailor-made, and I was amazed by it. My brand is
            now everywhere!
